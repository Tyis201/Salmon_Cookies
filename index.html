         <h1>About Pat</h1>
         <p>I started this company way back in 2002.  I wanted to make a company that involved two of my favorite things fishing and baking.  I got the idea to start salmon cookies when i was sitting down in my boat floating along the river eating  choclate chip cookies that my grandma made when a big ole salmon jumped out of the river and snatched my cookie. This lead to me opening up my first shop in my home town of seattle.  From there we grew world wide making stores all around the world and still growing.</p>

        <h1>About our Cookies</h1>
        <p>We spent many hours working on the recipe to make the perfect cookie for our customers and everyone around the globe. In our cookies you will not find any nuts or GMO's. We also have options for gluten-free and vegan cookies so our cookies are available to all people alike. Unlike Jim's cookies, ours are served fresh out of the oven and frosted right infont of you so you don't get an old stale cookie.  </p>
